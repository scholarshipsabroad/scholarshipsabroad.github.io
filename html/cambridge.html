					<h2>Study in the UK: Cambridge Trust Scholarships for PhD Studies </h2>
					

					<h4>Deadline: December 6, 2017 and January 4, 2018.</h4>
					<p>
						The Cambridge Trust is offering the Vice-Chancellor’s Awards (for UK and EU students) and the Cambridge International Scholarships (for international students) for those undertaking PhD studies. The aim of the Vice-Chancellor’s Awards and Cambridge International Scholarships is to ensure that the 250 highest ranked students, irrespective of nationality, receive full financial support to undertake research leading to a PhD.
						Scholarship</p>
						<p>
							The Scholarships pay the University Composition Fee and a maintenance allowance sufficient for a single person. In order to maximise the number of Scholarships awarded, the Trust will, when appropriate, promote winners of Vice-Chancellor’s Awards and Cambridge International Scholarships to other full-cost awards with UK Research Councils, or partner organisations, or Departments or Colleges, who are willing to provide either the full amount or part of the cost of the scholarship.  Where part of the cost of a scholarship is offered, the Trust will meet the balance.</p>
							<p>
								In the case of students securing other full-cost scholarships, the Trust will be pleased to offer ‘honorary’ status which entitles them to become a Trust scholar without remuneration.
							</p>
							<h4>Eligibility</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Open to International students as well as UK and EU students</li>
								<li>Applicants must be intending to start a course for PhD studies at the University of Cambridge.</li>
								<li>Applicants may study any subject currently available at the University.</li>
								<li>All students, irrespective of nationality, are eligible to be considered for funding by the Trust.</li>
								<li>The Trust does not accept applications from students who are part-way through a course at Cambridge, unless they are applying for funding towards a higher degree course following graduation</li>
								<li>All students must be admitted to the University of Cambridge through the normal application procedures. The Trust plays no role in the admission of applicants to the University, and is not able to influence the chances of an applicant being offered a place.
									Selection Criteria</li>
									<li>A University Committee draws up one ranked list of all PhD candidates across all disciplines. </li>
									<li>The only factors taken into consideration in agreeing this list are </li>
									<ul>
										<li>academic qualifications</li>
										<li>references</li>
										<li>research potential.</li>
									</ul>
									<li>The financial situation of applicants does not affect the selection of scholarship winners.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Application</p>
								<p>All applicants should complete the funding section of the online application form via the Applicant Portal expressing their ‘wish to be considered for funding’.
									Applicants from countries outside the EU (classified as ‘overseas’ for fees purposes) who wish to start their PhDs in 2018-19 must apply by 6 December 2017.   Applicants from the UK and EU (paying the ‘home’ or EU rate for the University Composition Fee) must apply by 4 January 2018.</p>
									<p>Successful applicants are informed at the earliest opportunity and the Trust will announce the winners of the Cambridge International Scholarships for 2018-19, and the winners of the Vice-Chancellor’s Awards for that year, in early March 2018.</p>
