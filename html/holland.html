					<hr>


					<p>Applications are now open for the 2018 Kennisontwikkelings programma (KOP). The Netherlands Fellowship Programmes (NFP) entered a new phase as a new programme under the name Kennisontwikkelings programma (KOP), which aims to advance the development of the capacity, knowledge and quality of both individuals and institutions in higher and vocational education. In the first KOP round there will be scholarships for Short Courses.</p>


					<p>KOP NFP is initiated and fully funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the budget for development cooperation.</p>
					<p><strong>Fellowship Value</strong></p>
					<p>A KOP NFP fellowship is intended to supplement the salary that you should continue to receive during the study period in the Netherlands. The allowance is a contribution towards your costs of living, the costs of tuition fees, visas, travel, insurance and thesis research.</p>
					<p>If applicable, the fellowship holder is expected to cover the difference between the actual costs and the amount of the personal KOP NFP allowances. The fellowships are awarded in a very competitive selection to highly motivated professionals who are in a position to introduce the newly-acquired skills and knowledge into their employing organisation.</p>
